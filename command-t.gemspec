  The Command-T plug-in provides an extremely fast, intuitive mechanism for
  opening files with a minimal number of keystrokes. It's named "Command-T"
  because it is inspired by the "Go to File" window bound to Command-T in
  TextMate.

    Files are selected by typing characters that appear in their paths, and are
  ordered by an algorithm which knows that characters that appear in certain
  locations (for example, immediately after a path separator) should be given
  more weight.

  To search efficiently, especially in large projects, you should adopt a
  "path-centric" rather than a "filename-centric" mentality. That is you should
  think more about where the desired file is found rather than what it is
  called. This means narrowing your search down by including some characters
  from the upper path components rather than just entering characters from the
  filename itself.
